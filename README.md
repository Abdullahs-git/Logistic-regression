# Logistic Regression with Python

Estimated time needed: **30 minutes**

## 🎯 Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Use **Logistic Regression** for classification tasks  
- **Preprocess and clean data** for model training  
- **Implement Logistic Regression** on real-world data using Python and Scikit-learn  

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project demonstrates how to apply **Logistic Regression**, one of the most widely used algorithms for binary classification.  
The notebook walks through each stage of the ML workflow — from **data preprocessing** and **model training** to **evaluation** and **interpretation of results**.  

Key steps include:
- Data loading and exploration  
- Feature scaling and encoding  
- Building a logistic regression model  
- Evaluating performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  

---

## 📈 Results

The model successfully classifies categorical outcomes and provides probability-based predictions.  
Visualizations help interpret the decision boundary and assess model performance on test data.
